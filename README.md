## RimTales - A Story Exporter for Rimworld. 

Heavily based on 'Tale Log [Retold]' by Nandonalt, Spuddy. - 'https://bitbucket.org/spudbean/talelogretold/'
After fixing it for v1.3 I decided to carry on tweaking the code. Many thanks to the original authors for sharing the code.


# Original Description:
Every time something relevant happens on a colony, a "tale" is registered on the save so it can be used on art (like deaths, research, training and so on).
This mod adds a tab to the game window that shows to you every tale recorded on that save.
To avoid performance issues, the log will only update when you open it.
Also, this mod does not change tale recording, so it only shows what the game has recorded.

* __Filters__. Using the "filter" text field you can select what will be shown on the tab.

* __Invert__.  "Invert Order" will reverse the list. The default is most recent events first.

* __Colours__. "Show Colors": if disabled, all tales will be white.
